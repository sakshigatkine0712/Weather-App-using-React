# The Weather Application 

This project has been developed using React.js, creating a compact weather application for the purpose of retrieving current weather data for any city. 

The weather data is acquired by searching for the city name. In this project, the Open Weather API has been employed, which is a free weather API providing current weather information. 

However, it's worth noting that the API does not include date and time data. Consequently, the system's date and time have been utilized to address this omission.
